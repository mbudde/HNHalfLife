HNHalfLife
==========

Overview
--------
HNHalfLife is a Greasemonkey script designed to facilitate longer discussions on Hacker News.

Motivation
----------
Hacker News is a great source of news and an even better source of intelligent conversation.  Unfortunately, the half-life of discussions is painfully short.  Once an article moves from the frontpage, discussions quickly die off.

One potential reason is the website itself.  Unlike traditional forums, HN does not inform you when new comments are added to already viewed posts.  Furthermore, the threaded nature of posts make it nearly impossible to identify new comments unless you were directly part of the conversation.  Lastly, the one feature which may help ("saved" stories page) is hidden away under your profile. 

This script is an attempt to remedy that problem.  HNHalfLife identifies and highlights new comments, as well as relocating the "saved" page to your main navigation toolbar

Etc.

Being absolutely new to jQuery (and Javascript), it is likely that some code is inefficient, bulky or ugly.  Any improvements or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
