HNHalfLife
==========

HNHalfLife is a Greasemonkey script that is designed to make discussion half-lifes on Hacker News longer.  Hacker News has excellent discussions...while the article remains on the front-page.  Unfortunately, the threaded style of comments and lack of indication about new comments makes it very difficult to keep lively conversations flowing.

This script is an attempt to remedy that problem.  HNHalfLife monitors the posts you read and alerts you when there are new comments, highlights the new comments and provides quick-links.  It also integrates your "Saved" tab into the header navigation.
